        <p>
            The mine view is the most important view in DLE and shows you
            the current mine as it is. Mastering its use can considerably
            help with level design and make it easier.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            The camera in the mine view can be moved around in several ways:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>quick navigation with the mouse</li>
            <li>camera panning, zooming and rotation controls in the <a href="toolbar.html">toolbar</a></li>
            <li>camera panning, zooming and rotation controls in the <a href="view.html">View menu</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This page will focus on quick navigation. To move the camera around,
            hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and move the mouse around. Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>
            with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will allow you to rotate the camera around the
            current center point. Zooming is possible in three ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>with the mouse wheel (without <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> held)</li>
            <li>by holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and the right mouse button,
                and then moving the mouse up or down</li>
            <li>holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then left-clicking to zoom in
                or right-clicking or zoom out</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Note that panning forward/back (or in/out) is different from
            zooming in that only the latter will change the center of camera
            rotation. To pan in/out, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and the left mouse
            button or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and use the mouse wheel.
        </p>

        <p>
            To control the speed of camera movement when <em>not</em> using
            the mouse, change the <a href="settings.html#editor">view move rate
            and rotate rate</a> from the settings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
        <p>
            The appearance of the mine itself can be customized in several ways.
            You can toggle between wireframe only, wireframe + textures and
            texture only modes from the <a href="view.html">View menu</a>.
            In addition, from the same menu you can toggle whether the mine will
            show the current light levels (or always appear bright) and whether
            certain features or objects should be displayed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="selection">Selecting</h2>
        <p>
            Left-clicking will select a new point/line/side/segment/object, depending
            on your currently active <a href="selection.mode">selection mode</a>,
            while right-clicking will always select the nearest object.
        </p>

        <h2 id="tagging">Tagging</h2>
        <p>
            Holding the left mouse button will draw a rectangle that can be used
            to quickly tag large blocks. The default mode is to tag everything that
            fits within the rectange; holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> will untag instead.
        </p>

        <h2 id="dragging">Dragging</h2>
        <p>
            The current point can be easily dragged by holding the left mouse
            button over the point, after which point it can be dragged with
            the mouse.
        </p>

        <h2 id="quicksel">Quick Selection</h2>
        <p>
            Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> enables the quick selection mode, which
            can be configured from the <a href="#context">context menu</a>. It
            allows you to quickly select any point, line, side or segment 
            (depending on your currently active selection mode) from the mine
            with your mouse by left-clicking or right-clicking. Quick selection
            is not available in object or block selection modes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="context">Context Menu</h2>
        <p>
            The context menu can be opened by right-clicking the menu while
            holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>.
