        <p>
            Levels can be converted into different formats, as well as exported
            into Overload levels (only geometry).
        </p>

        <p>
            When converting a Descent 1 level to a Descent 2 (including Vertigo
            and D2X-XL) level, a separate texture conversion dialog will appear
            that allows you to customize how the textures will be converted.
            The texture on the left shows the texture to be converted, while
            the texture on the right will show the texture that it will
            be converted to. Make sure to go through the list on the left.
        </p>
