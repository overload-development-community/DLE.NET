                        engines, and thus levels created in one are relatively easy to port
                        to another. In terms of level design, Descent 2 adds its own set of
                        robots, completely revamps the trigger system, introduces per-level
                        palettes, increases level restrictions, has a different set of textures
                        and adds support for per-level texture and robot modifications.

                        effects, colored lighting, new trigger types, and significantly
                        increased level restrictions. D2X-XL enhanced levels can only
                        be played in D2X-XL.

                        XL levels are mostly fundamentally Descent 2 levels, and thus
                        will allow the use of all Descent 2 features; however, XL
                        also supports some extra features in Descent 1 levels.

                        one at a time. On most difficulties, robot makers can only be activated
                        three times, after which they will no longer activate.

                        A Descent 1 or 2 level consists of segments, which are geometrically
                        strictly convex hexahedra (in layman's terms, a cube that can be
                        distorted in any way possible, as long its own sides do not intersect
                        each other or are on the same plane as each other).
                        A segment consists of 6 sides, 12 lines and 8 points, and every
                        mine must contain at least one segment.
                        If a segment is connected to another, it is a <i>neighboring segment</i>
                        of that segment.

                        one side can be selected at a time, of which one line can be selected
                        at a time, of which one point can be selected at a time. The degree

                        flies through the wall or if the attached monitor/control panel
                        is destroyed. When triggered, they perform actions like activating
                        robot makers or opening doors or walls. A trigger can have
                        at most ten targets, which are all one side of a segment.

                        In D2X-XL, triggers may also be attached to objects and thus
                        be <i>object triggers</i>, activating when a power-up is
                        collected, a robot is destroyed, or upon some other behavior.
                        XL triggers can also have more metatrigger behavior, such as
                        activating, disabling or enabling other triggers. XL also
                        makes it possible to have objects as trigger targets.

                        approximately 10 units wide. A decent-sized level is usually

                        of the game are at around 32000 units in both directions.
