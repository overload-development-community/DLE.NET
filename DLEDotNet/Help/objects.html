            Objects include players, robots, powerups and other items, which
            are usually necessary for levels to be playable. While objects are
            associated with a segment, their position is mostly otherwise
            independent of them, and they can placed anywhere within a segment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Objects can be moved around while in <a href="selection.html">object mode</a>.

                        and should usually be close to the secret exit itself.
