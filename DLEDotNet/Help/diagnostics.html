            This tool can be used to check for problems in the mine that can
            affect the playability and stability of the mine while played
            in-game. It also contains statistics for the level.
        </p>

        <h2 id="stats">Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            All of these rows display both the current value and the maximum.
            (TODO: what does the cont mean?)
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the maximum values will depend on the level type, with
            limits being typically higher for Descent 2 levels than Descent 1
            levels and D2X-XL considerably raising most limits.

        <p>
            The problem report is generated whenever the mine is checked
            by using the "check mine" option. "show problem" shows the segment
            or object that contains the problem, "clear list" clears the list,
            "auto fix bugs" controls whether problems should be automatically
            fixed on check if possible, and "show warnings" controls whether the
            problem list should contain warnings that may affect playability.
        </p>

            Below is a list of possible errors and warnings:
