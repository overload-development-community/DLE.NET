        <p>
            All of the next/previous actions will only work in the correct mode
            (for example, "Next object" requires the object mode), and if the
            correct mode isn't selected, it is selected instead. This means that
            using "next object" in side mode will switch to object mode <em>without</em>
            changing to the next object.
        </p>
