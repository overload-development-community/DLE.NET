            <i>Walls</i> are, by their nature, attached to a side of a segment. They are used
            to add triggers, obstacles, decorations or simply close off areas.
            Walls, much like closed sides (those not connected to a segment) will always
            have a texture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Note that walls present on both sides are technically two separate walls. With the
            exception of Overlay walls, all walls must be on an open side, i.e. a side that is
            connected  to another segment, and thus basically always a single wall in-game will
            actually correspond to two walls in the editor.
            <em>Walls (except overlays) only present on one side should usually not be used.</em>
        </p>

        <h2 id="data">Wall Data</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>current wall</i> is the wall located on the currently selected side, if any.
            If the current side has no wall, all "wall data" controls are disabled, except for the
            wall type, which is used to control the wall type that is added once the "add" button
            is clicked.

                        A wall that can be damaged and destroyed by the player. Used for
                        hostage doors, guide bot doors (Descent 2) and destroyable walls
                        (not used in the original levels). The "Strength" controls the amount
                        of damage necessary to destroy the wall and is usually set at 100%.
                        Blastable walls must have a corresponding blastable wall on the other side,
                        or the level is malformed and may crash the game.

                        appears pitch black with adjustable transparency. Robots can spot
                        players through Cloaked walls and will attempt to fire, but projectiles
                        will not pass through unless a transparent texture is used.

                        A simple closed wall. Used for solid walls, grates, fans and
                        (in Descent 2) force fields. Players or robots cannot pass through
                        Close walls, but if the wall has transparent gaps (such as grates),
                        projectiles can fly and robots can spot and fire at the player through them.

                        the color can be customized by changing the light color and the
                        Strength value, respectively.

                    <td>
                        A special type of wall that can be opened and closed by the player,
                        guide bot (Descent 2) and some robots. While open, players, robots
                        and projectiles can pass through freely. Doors always feature
                        an animation, which is controlled by the Clip # setting.
                        Most of the flags concern doors specifically.
                        Doors must have a corresponding door on the other side, or the level
                        is malformed and may crash the game.

                        by players, robots and projectiles; in essence, a pass-through wall.
                        Used mainly for some effects, such as fuel cells in energy centers,
                        the secret exit entrance (D2), water(falls) (D2) and lava(falls).

                        for completely opaque/solid walls. Rarely used, as Close is used instead,
                        or the two sides are simply separated.

                        A wall that can be passed through and is invisible. Intended
                        mostly for triggers that are activated when a player passes through
                        a certain side, but also used for walls that may later close.

                        The only wall type that must be on a closed side, i.e. a side
                        that is not connected to another segment. Overlay walls are used
                        to add triggers to monitors and control panels that activate
                        when they are destroyed.
