        <h1>How to browse Help</h1>
        
        <p>
            For browsing help, there are two distinct options:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A frame-based setup that can be used <a href="index.html" target="_parent">here</a>, if your browser (still) has frame support</li>
            <li>A basic table of contents / index page <a href="00index.html" target="_parent">here</a> that allows you to view a page one at a time</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If you are using the former, you can switch to another page by using the sidebar on the left.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to open a help page for an existing tool, you can right-click the tool on non-floating layouts
            or use the help button in the top-right corner of the tool on the floating layout.
        </p>
