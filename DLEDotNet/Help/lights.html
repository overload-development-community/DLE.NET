            Lighting is an important part of Descent levels. This tool is used
            to compute the new light values for the entire mine based on the
            existing lights and texture brightness values (which are not changed
            by computing new lighting).

                        brightness; 50% means half brightness and 100% means
                        full brightness.

                        may occur with some light configurations, so it is

                        "dynamic segment light calculation" is used, as a factor
                        for the final value.
