        <h1>Curve Generator</h1>
        <p>
            The curve generator can be used to automatically generate curved
            tunnels between two sides. To use the curve generator, start by
            selecting the sides, one as the current side and the other as
            the <a href="selection.html">other side</a>. It is accessed from
            Tools &gt; Curve Generator or by pressing <kbd>G</kbd>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The generated tunnel will follow a BÃ©zier curve, the parameters
            of which can be adjusted as such:
        </p>
        
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th class="main">Controls</th>
                    <th class="narrow">Action</th>
                    <th>Explanation</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td class="main"><kbd>Ctrl+8</kbd></td>
                    <td class="narrow">Push control point further</td>
                    <td rowspan="2">
                        The <i>control points</i> are situated on the normals of the
                        selected sides and affect the curvature and thus the
                        final shape of the tunnel. The closer the control point
                        is to the side, the "faster" the tunnel will start curving
                        away from that side.
                        <p></p>
                        The movement rate is controlled by the
                        <a href="settings.html#editor">mine move rate</a>.
                        To move the control point on the other side, use
                        <kbd>Space</kbd> to switch to the other side.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="main"><kbd>Ctrl+9</kbd></td>
                    <td class="narrow">Pull control point closer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="main"><kbd>Alt+8</kbd></td>
                    <td class="narrow">Increase granularity</td>
                    <td rowspan="2">
                        The <i>granularity</i> controls the length of segments used
                        to construct the tunnel. The higher the granularity,
                        the smoother the tunnel will be, but also the more
                        segments will be used (and there's only so many a
                        mine can have).
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="main"><kbd>Alt+9</kbd></td>
                    <td class="narrow">Decrease granularity</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            The tunnel can be twisted by changing the current point by
            pressing <kbd>P</kbd>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tunnel will adopt the textures of the current segment. To finish
            creating the tunnel, click Tools &gt; Curve Generator again or press
            <kbd>G</kbd> to confirm whether the tunnel should be created or not.
