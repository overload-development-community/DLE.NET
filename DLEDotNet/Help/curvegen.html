        <h1>Curve Generator</h1>
        <p>
            The curve generator can be used to automatically generate curved
            tunnels between two sides. To use the curve generator, start by
            selecting the sides, one as the current side and the other as
            the <a href="selection.html">other side</a>. It is accessed from
            Tools &gt; Curve Generator or by pressing <kbd>G</kbd>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The generated tunnel will follow a BÃ©zier curve, the parameters
            of which can be adjusted by using <kbd>Ctrl+8</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+9</kbd>
            to control the curvature (by the distance of the control
            points from the sides; 8 increases and 9 decreases) and
            <kbd>Alt+8</kbd> and <kbd>Alt+9</kbd> to adjust the granularity
            (length of segments in the tunnel; 8 makes segments shorter and 9
            makes them longer). All of these operations will be done for the
            current side, but you can use <kbd>Space</kbd> to switch to the other
            segment so that the same operations can be done on the other side.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tunnel can be twisted by changing the current point by
            pressing <kbd>P</kbd>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tunnel will adopt the textures of the current segment. To finish
            creating the tunnel, click Tools &gt; Curve Generator again or press
            <kbd>G</kbd> to confirm whether the tunnel should be created or not.
        </p>
