        <h1>Movement</h1>
        
        <p>
            One of the most important actions in Descent level editing is
            moving things around within the mine. in DLE.NET, this is accomplished
            by using the numpad in your keyboard, or the "editor toolbar" available
            from the VIew menu.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "selection" that is moved around depends on the currently active
            <a href="selection.html#modes">selection mode</a>. All movement actions
            are relative to the currently selected side.
        </p>

                        Pulls the selection closer from the direction that
                        is reached by moving from the center of the current
                        segment towards the selected side, 
                        i.e. moves the selection inside towards the segment.

                In side mode, the movement controls (that move up, down, left
                or right) will also rotate the side rather than simply translating
                it in order to make it easier to create turning tunnels. This can
                be suppressed by holding Numpad Point/Comma, holding Shift when
                using the editor toolbar or by marking the side and using block mode instead.
