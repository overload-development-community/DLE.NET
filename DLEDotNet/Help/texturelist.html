        <h1>Texture List</h1>
        <p>
            The texture list displays a grid of available textures (or the textures
            used in the mine if <a href="settings.html#visibility">used textures</a> is enabled),
            and allows picking textures for the <a href="selection.html">selection</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The list below shows the controls:
        </p>
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th class="main">Control</th>
                    <th>Action</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

                    <td>
                        Set the currently selected texture as the 1st texture
                        for the selected side.
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        Set the currently selected texture as the 2nd texture
                        for the selected side.

                    <td>
                        Finds the next segment/side with the given texture and
                        selects it. If the texture is not used in the level,
                        does nothing.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                        Set the currently selected texture as the overlay texture
                        for the <a href="objects.html">selected object</a> (only works if the object is a
                        robot or reactor).
