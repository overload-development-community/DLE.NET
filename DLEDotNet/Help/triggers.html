            Triggers are actions that are carried out when a player passes
            through a specific wall or destroys/picks up a specific object.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>current trigger</i> is either the trigger on the
            current wall if "standard trigger" is checked, or the trigger
            on the selected object if "object trigger" is checked.

            Triggers in Descent 1 can do multiple actions at once; a single
            trigger can, for example, be both a "control doors" and "robot maker"
            trigger, in which case it will open doors and make robots for
            all targets that support that specific action.

            If not mentioned separately, the "strength" and "time" values
            have no effect, and the trigger target(s) do not matter.

                        destroyed in order to activate triggers, they are
                        by nature one-shot).

                        make the switch not destroy itself, but still activate
                        the trigger. This makes it possible to activate
                        switch triggers many times. Mutually exclusive
                        with "autoplay"; will be disabled if "autoplay" is
