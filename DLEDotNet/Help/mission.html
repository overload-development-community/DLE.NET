        <p>
            A <em>mission</em> is a collection of levels with associated data,
            such as mission title, briefings, custom files, etc. This editor is
            designed to edit mission info as well as the list of levels in the
            mission.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order for more than one level to be contained within a mission,
            all of the mission's level files and most other files must be
            within a .HOG archive, as opposed to there simply being a .RDL/.RL2
            level file on its own.
        </p>

        <p>
            When editing mission info, it is important to click "save", since
            otherwise changes to the mission will not be saved (they are <em>not</em>
            saved with the level itself).

                        The list of levels in this mission. It contains the
                        file names of the levels as they are stored within the
                        .HOG file. A file name on its own is a normal level.
                        <p></p>
                        To add secret leveÄºs, use the file name, followed by a
                        comma and the first normal level from which the secret
                        level is reachable. For example, <code>secret1.rl2,1</code>
                        means that the secret level is under the file name
                        secret1.rl2 and is the secret level that is accessed
                        from all secret exits starting from level 1. If followed by
                        another line like <code>secret2.rl2,5</code>, "secret1.rl2"
                        will then be accessible from levels 1-4.
