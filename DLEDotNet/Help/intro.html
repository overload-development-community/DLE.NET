        <h1>DLE.NET - Descent Level Editor .NET</h1>
        <img src="images/splash.png" />

        <p>
            <b>DLE.NET</b> is a level and mission editor for
            <a target="_parent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(1995_video_game)">Descent (1)</a>,
            <a target="_parent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_II">Descent 2</a> and
            <a target="_parent" href="http://descent2.de/">D2X-XL</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <p>It is an improved .NET port of <a target="_parent" href="http://descent2.de/dle-frames.html">DLE-XP</a> by Dietfrid Mali, which is itself based on
            <a target="_parent" href="http://descent.brainware.net/page-products-dmb-2.php">Descent Mission Builder 2</a> by Bryan Aamot of Brainware.</p>
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to use DLE.NET to its fullest potential, you need to own
            a full copy of Descent and/or Descent 2.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
            Controls are documented on their various pages and are also available
            by browsing through the menus. Note that any controls mentioned on
            these help pages are the <em>default</em> controls for those actions,
            which will eventually be customizable.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a new level</h2>
        <p>
            Create a new level by clicking "New..." from the File menu. The
            new level dialog asks for the level name and type. The type
            options are.

            <ul>
                <li>Descent 1</li>
                <li>Descent 2</li>
                <li>D2 Vertigo (Descent 2 Vertigo, required to use new
                    robot types introduced in Vertigo)</li>
                <li>D2X-XL (extra features, only playable in D2X-XL)</li>
            </ul>

            A level can be converted later, but most conversions cannot be
            done without hassle. The general rule is that in the above list,
            converting to one of the types below is easy, while converting
            to one of the types above is difficult.
