        <p>
            A .HOG file is an archive containing levels and other associated
            data. It's used to store the contents of a mission (except the
            <a href="mission.html">metadata</a>, which is in a separate file).
            It is accessed from "File &gt; Edit Mission HOG..." or when first
            opening a .HOG file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the file names in a .HOG file are in 8.3 format, and thus
            the file name must be at most 8 characters long with a 3 character
            long file extension.
        </p>
