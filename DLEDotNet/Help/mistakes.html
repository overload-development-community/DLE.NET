        <h3>this should be expanded</h3>

        <p>
            There are many level design mistakes that have a negative effect on
            the playability or appearance of the level. This page lists some
            things to keep in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most important of all: 
            <em>always</em> check the mine before finishing work on it.
            The diagnostics tool can point out several issues that could,
            if unaddressed, ruin the experience or cause the level to crash the game.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Make sure the exit door is linked to the reactor, or else
                the player will be forced to lose a life (and all of their items!)
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid placing enemies into the starting room. The player
                should generally be safe for at least some time or until they
                start moving around.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid distorting segments or sides too much. The game can
                automatically convert a side into two triangles, but this can
                cause issues with the collision engine or stretched textures.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't scale textures up too much - the resolution of the
                game's textures is fairly low, which is very apparent if a
                texture is stretched over a large face.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't forget that robot makers can activate an infinite number
                of times on Insane.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't place too many robots too far from the player. They won't
                fire from beyond a certain distance, which can make them
                sitting ducks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Paper-thin solid walls are discouraged. The player should not
                be able to ram themselves against a paper-thin edge - it
                causes strange results with the collision engine. Sharp edges
                in general may cause issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                Always have one "end of exit tunnel" side in the level at the
                very end of the exit tunnel. Don't place them anywhere else,
                particularly in places where the player could access them directly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some players may be left frustrated if repeatedly forced to
                take unavoidable damage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Not all solid textures have a corresponding secret door texture.
                Choose their location wisely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hostages should be positioned 4.9 - 5.0 units above the floor.
                When added to a default 20x20x20 segment, the hostage will be at 10
                units above the floor, which causes them to appear to levitate.
                Leaving them that way looks jarring.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is part of Descent tradition to place a "starting door"
                right behind or close to the player's spawn point. It should
                use the door05 clip and be locked from the player's side, to
                give players the impression that the player entered the level
                through that door.
            </li>
            <li>
                It should go without saying; test your levels before
                releasing them to other players.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Always include a reactor in the level, even if it has a 
                boss robot or if the player is meant to end the level without
                even causing the countdown. Most versions of the game can
                tolerate a missing reactor, but not all can. If the level
                has a boss robot, the reactor will be removed on level load,
                so you don't need to worry about the player being able to
                somehow access it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the segment the reactor is in is set to be a
                reactor segment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Never add doors that are only present on one side, or the
                game will crash when the door opens or closes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While 350 objects is the maximum, it's recommended to have
                less than 250-300, since the object limit also affects
                projectiles. Because of this, if the level is very close to
                the object limit, it'll be very difficult for the player or
                robots to fire, which can render the level nearly unplayable.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your level is for co-op, always place all of the co-op
                player spawns (8-10) so that there is exactly one of each in
                the level.
            </li>
        </ul>
