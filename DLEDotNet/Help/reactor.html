        <div>
            <a href="#targets">Reactor Targets</a> &middot;

        <p>
            The <em>reactor</em> is an important part of most Descent levels.
            In most levels, the end objective is to locate and destroy the
            reactor and then get out through the exit door before the countdown
            reaches zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that for technical reasons, <em>every</em> singleplayer or co-op
            level should have exactly one reactor, even if the player can't
            access it or if the level has a boss robot (in which case, the reactor
            is automatically removed on level load). This does not necessarily
            apply to D2X-XL levels.
        </p>

        <h2 id="targets">Reactor Targets</h2>
        <p>
            The reactor itself acts as a trigger when destroyed. The trigger
            type is always "control doors" on Descent 1 or "open door" in Descent
            2; thus the trigger targets must be doors for them to be affected.
            Any target that is a door will be opened the moment the exit
            countdown begins (but note that such doors must not be "door auto",
            or they will close automatically after a few seconds).
        </p>

        <p>
            Much like with normal triggers, at most ten targets are allowed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="options">Descent 2 Options</h2>
        <p>
            All of these options will only work in Descent 2 levels;
            they are not available in Descent 1, where the countdown time is
            constant and cannot be changed by the level.
        </p>

                    <td>
                        The reactor countdown time in seconds. The default value
                        is 30. Note that like the setting says, this is only 
                        the time on the highest difficulty (insane); on other
                        difficulties, the time is set to be a constant multiple
                        of this value depending on the difficulty level.

                    <td>
                        The number of shields the reactor has. The default value
                        is as follows:

                            <li>normal level: 200 + (50 * N), where N is the
                                level number (how many normal levels there were
                                before this level; thus first level N = 0)</li>
                            <li>secret level: 350 + (150 * N), where N is the
                                secret level number (how many secret levels there were
                                before this level; thus first secret level N = 0)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <td>
                        The segment that contains the secret level return
                        spawn point. Its position can also be adjusted under
                        the <a href="objects.html">object tool</a> as "secret object".
                    </td>
